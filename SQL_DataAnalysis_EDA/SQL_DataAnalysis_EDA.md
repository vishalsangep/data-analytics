Objective:
This project aims to provide insights for an iOS app developer, assisting in determining the type of app to build. The focus areas include identifying popular app categories, deciding whether the app 
should be paid or free, determining an appropriate price for a paid app, and maximizing user ratings. The final recommendations are based on various analyses conducted on the provided datasets.

Data Analysis Steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Checked the number of unique apps in both datasets (AppleStore and appleStore_description).
Identified missing values in key fields, including track_name, user_rating, prime_genre, and app_desc.
Analyzed the number of apps per genre to understand genre distribution.

2. Overview of App Ratings:
Examined the range of user ratings, providing minimum, maximum, and average ratings.
Explored the supported devices, including the minimum, maximum, and average number of supported devices.

3. Data Analysis:
Analyzed the ranking of paid vs. free apps, investigating if paid apps have higher ratings than free apps.
Explored the relationship between language support and user ratings, categorizing apps based on the number of supported languages.
Identified genres with the least average ratings.
Investigated the correlation between the length of app descriptions and user ratings, categorizing app descriptions into short, medium, and long.

Final Recommendations:
Based on the analyses conducted, the following recommendations are provided for the iOS app developer:

App Pricing:
Paid apps tend to have better ratings than free apps.

Language Support:
Apps supporting 10 to 30 languages have better ratings.

Genre Considerations:
Finance and book apps generally have lower ratings.

App Description Length:
Apps with longer descriptions tend to have better ratings.

Minimum Rating Threshold:
Aim for a new app to have a rating higher than 3.5.

Competitive Landscape:
Games and entertainment apps face high competition.

These recommendations aim to guide decision-making in the app development process, with a focus on factors that contribute to higher user ratings and overall success in the app market.
