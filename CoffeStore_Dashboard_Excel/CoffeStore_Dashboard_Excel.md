Project Documentation: Data Transformation and Dashboard Visualization

Objective
This project involves data transformation and dashboard visualization for improved analysis and decision-making. The primary tasks include populating customer information using VLOOKUP 
from other sheets, using a switch case to convert abbreviations into meaningful names, adjusting date and size formats, adding currency formatting, and creating a dashboard visualization 
with a pivot table and slicer.

Data Transformation Steps

1. Populating Customer Information
Utilized VLOOKUP to populate customer names, emails, and other details from other sheets into the main dataset.

2. Switch Case for Abbreviations
Implemented a switch case to convert abbreviations into meaningful names for better clarity and understanding.

3. Date Format Adjustment
Modified the date format from the American format to a more general format (dd-mmm-yyyy) for consistency.

4. Size Column Formatting
Formatted the size column to display weights in the format (0.0 kg) for improved readability.

5. Currency Formatting
Added currency formatting to the unit size and sales columns to enhance visual representation.

6. Checking for Duplicates
Conducted a check for duplicates in the dataset, ensuring data integrity. No duplicates were found.
Dashboard Visualization
Dashboard Visual 1: Sales Analysis by Coffee Type
Inserted a pivot table to analyze sales data.
Ordered the pivot table by sales, categorized by coffee type.
Added a timeline to provide a temporal perspective on sales trends.
Implemented a slicer to enable interactive filtering for a more user-friendly experience.

Summary:
The data transformation steps involved populating customer information, converting abbreviations into meaningful names, adjusting date and size formats, and applying currency formatting.
 These transformations enhance the dataset for more insightful analysis. The dashboard visualization, Sales Analysis by Coffee Type, incorporates a pivot table, timeline, and slicer for
effective data exploration and decision-making. The project aims to provide a streamlined and visually appealing platform for data analysis.
